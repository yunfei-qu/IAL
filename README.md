# IAL
This is for the experiments in "Convergence rate of inexact augmented Lagrangian method with practical relative error criterion for composite convex programming".

- BP.rar is for the Basis pursuit problem;
- Lasso_syn.rar is for the Constrained Lasso problem with synthetic data;
- Lasso_real.rar is for the Constrained Lasso problem with real data;
    - First download the real data from 'releases data';
    - Adjust the folder path in Lasso_real_3.m.
